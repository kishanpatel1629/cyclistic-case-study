# üö¥ Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study

**Google Data Analytics Capstone Project**\
12-Month Analysis (January‚ÄìDecember 2023)\
**Role:** Junior Data Analyst\
**Objective:** To help Cyclistic understand the behavioral differences between casual riders and annual members and recommend data-driven strategies to increase membership subscriptions.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This case study was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Certification. As a junior data analyst, I conducted a complete analysis of Cyclistic‚Äôs bike-share data for the entire year of 2023. The purpose was to identify patterns in rider behavior, uncover key differences between casual riders and annual members, and provide recommendations that support Cyclistic‚Äôs marketing strategy to convert more casual users into long-term members.

I followed the entire six-step data analysis process: **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act**.



The project involved:

‚Ä¢ Preparing and cleaning over **4.2 million** ride records from 12 separate CSV files using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)\
‚Ä¢ Designing and running SQL queries to answer Cyclistic‚Äôs core business questions\
‚Ä¢ Creating insightful and interactive Tableau dashboards to communicate findings\
‚Ä¢ Documenting all analysis, visuals, and findings in GitHub for easy recruiter access

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Source

The original trip data used in this project was provided by [Divvy Bikes (operated by Lyft)](https://divvybikes.com/system-data), which makes its anonymized historical trip data publicly available for free use.\
This dataset is used officially in the **Google Data Analytics Capstone Project** and is licensed for educational and non-commercial purposes. It contains monthly records of ride activity, user type, station names, ride length, and bike type.

All 12 files from January to December 2023 were downloaded directly from this trusted and publicly accessible source. This ensures the project is built using legitimate and verifiable data.

## üñºÔ∏è Key Visual Insights

### 1. Total Rides by User Type

**Insight:** Annual members account for the majority of total rides, showing stronger long-term engagement. Casual riders ride less frequently, which highlights the business potential of converting them into members.

### 2. Average Ride Duration by Weekday and User Type

<img src="images/Avg Duration by Day and User Type.png" width="600"/>

**Insight:** Casual riders consistently take longer trips, especially on weekends. Members ride shorter distances, mostly during weekdays. This indicates leisure usage by casual riders and commuting behavior by members.

### 3. Hourly Usage Pattern by User Type

<img src="images/Hourly Usage by User Type.png" width="800"/>

**Insight:** Members ride most during peak commute hours (8 AM and 5‚Äì6 PM), while casual riders peak around late mornings to afternoons, aligning with leisure-time activities. This supports weekday vs. weekend marketing strategies.

### 4. Bike Type Preference by User Type

<img src="images/Avg Duration by Day and User Type.png" width="600"/>

**Insight:** Both casual riders and members heavily prefer classic bikes, but casual users show slightly more variety in choosing electric bikes. This helps plan future equipment distribution.

### 5. Top Start and End Stations for Casual Riders

**Insight:** The most frequent start and end stations are near popular tourist spots like Navy Pier and Lakefront Trail. These locations are ideal for promoting membership plans through digital campaigns.

## ‚ùì Business Questions Addressed

**1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**\
Through analysis of ride duration, weekday trends, ride frequency, and time-of-day usage, I found that casual riders take longer trips mostly on weekends, while members show consistent commuting patterns.

**2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?**\
By analyzing long-duration rides and top tourist routes, I identified strong use cases where casual users may benefit from cost savings if they switched to a membership model.

**3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?**\
Using peak hours, station hotspots, and trip patterns, I suggest launching campaigns focused on high-volume locations and times, such as weekend afternoons near lakefront areas.
